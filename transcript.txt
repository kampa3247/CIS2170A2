1
00:00:00,300 -- 00:00:01,933
This is a regular water faucet,

2
00:00:01,933 -- 00:00:02,766
it's expensive,

3
00:00:02,766 -- 00:00:04,966
low quality and doesn't track water consumption.

4
00:00:05,166 -- 00:00:07,633
Our product is a new and improved faucet that contains

5
00:00:07,633 -- 00:00:09,700
many more filters and tracks water consumption.

6
00:00:09,700 -- 00:00:11,433
by tracking users water consumption

7
00:00:11,433 -- 00:00:13,766
we hold weekly competitions that allow

8
00:00:13,833 -- 00:00:16,000
users to get discounts on eco friendly products.

9
00:00:16,933 -- 00:00:19,433
The manufactured ecosystem that our fun theory

10
00:00:19,433 -- 00:00:21,066
supports is water regulation.

11
00:00:21,066 -- 00:00:22,333
The amount of water people

12
00:00:22,333 -- 00:00:25,133
consume every day is unnecessary and wasteful.

13
00:00:25,633 -- 00:00:27,566
Water regulation keeps track of how much water

14
00:00:27,566 -- 00:00:28,233
everyone gets

15
00:00:28,233 -- 00:00:30,866
and it helps people not over consume water to the point

16
00:00:30,866 -- 00:00:31,933
where it's unstable.

17
00:00:32,233 -- 00:00:34,500
Now that we've discussed the manufactured ecosystem

18
00:00:34,500 -- 00:00:37,100
let's go into depth about how exactly our fun theory

19
00:00:37,100 -- 00:00:37,800
design works.

20
00:00:38,066 -- 00:00:39,500
Our fun theory idea.

21
00:00:39,766 -- 00:00:42,500
The fun theory idea behind our redesigned water faucet

22
00:00:42,500 -- 00:00:43,033
is to utilize

23
00:00:43,733 -- 00:00:45,633
human competitiveness through game like feature,

24
00:00:45,733 -- 00:00:47,366
fun interactions,

25
00:00:47,366 -- 00:00:48,400
and keeping them aware

26
00:00:48,400 -- 00:00:50,866
through presenting real time water usage to

27
00:00:50,866 -- 00:00:52,533
encourage water conservation.

28
00:00:53,100 -- 00:00:54,333
This is accomplished through a

29
00:00:54,333 -- 00:00:55,500
combination of technology,

30
00:00:55,933 -- 00:00:56,800
data tracking

31
00:00:56,800 -- 00:00:57,833
and rewards.

32
00:00:57,966 -- 00:00:59,366
The intended outcome of the redesign

33
00:00:59,700 -- 00:01:02,300
is to make people aware of their water consumption

34
00:01:02,366 -- 00:01:04,566
and encourage them to conserve more water

35
00:01:04,566 -- 00:01:07,200
using the tools provided by the Smart faucet

36
00:01:07,200 -- 00:01:08,666
and its interactive app.

37
00:01:09,166 -- 00:01:11,166
The shortcomings of the original design.

38
00:01:11,466 -- 00:01:12,866
The first was lack of awareness.

39
00:01:12,866 -- 00:01:15,366
The original faucet design is not providing users with

40
00:01:15,366 -- 00:01:18,033
real time information about their water consumption,

41
00:01:18,100 -- 00:01:20,400
making them unaware of their usage patterns.

42
00:01:20,800 -- 00:01:23,566
There's no incentives for conservation.

43
00:01:23,566 -- 00:01:25,866
Without any form of incentive like rewards,

44
00:01:25,866 -- 00:01:28,300
users may not have felt motivated to actively

45
00:01:28,300 -- 00:01:29,700
reduce water consumption.

46
00:01:30,000 -- 00:01:31,200
Our Smart Faucet

47
00:01:31,200 -- 00:01:32,700
Real Time Data tracking.

48
00:01:32,700 -- 00:01:34,966
The incorporation of a smart faucet

49
00:01:34,966 -- 00:01:37,533
and an interactive app provides users with real time

50
00:01:37,533 -- 00:01:39,666
data on their water consumption.

51
00:01:39,733 -- 00:01:40,500
This addresses

52
00:01:40,500 -- 00:01:42,466
the lack of awareness in the original design

53
00:01:42,466 -- 00:01:46,300
by making users more conscious of their usage habits.

54
00:01:46,333 -- 00:01:48,166
Gamification and rewards.

55
00:01:48,166 -- 00:01:49,966
Introducing a competitive element

56
00:01:49,966 -- 00:01:51,533
which appeals to the

57
00:01:51,533 -- 00:01:54,333
human nature of competitiveness and reward system

58
00:01:54,333 -- 00:01:55,466
through the app

59
00:01:55,666 -- 00:01:58,366
encourages users to actively reduce water consumption.
